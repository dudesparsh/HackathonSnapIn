Prompt text

Given a command we need the output as mentioned below:
Command: "A web page with a heading a rich text and 2 Buttons in a container."
Answer:
[{
"heading_1";[],  
"rich_text_1":[],
"container_1":["button_1","button_2"],
"button_1":[],
"button_2":[]       
}]
To give you context on what is going on, here we trying to write the given command as an array of dictionaries.
In the above example since container contains two buttons, we treat them as containers children and add them to the array.
Heading, rich text and button do not have any children so they have an empty array.

All possible components that can be used are: "container", "button", "rich text", "text area", "heading", "input","check box","pill".
Naming format must be followed like containers should be named as "container_{number}" example "container_1" similarly for "buttons","rich_text","text_area","input","heading","check_box","pill".

Every component has some specific features which are listed below:
"container" : "type" and "direction".
    possible values for the features of "container" are:
        "type" can take 5 values "section","article","header","footer","aside","address","main" default value is "section".
        "direction" can take 2 value "row" and "column" default value is "column".
"button" : "size","disabled","variant" and "label"
    possible values for the features of "button" are:
        "size" can take 3 values small,medium and large used as  "sm","md" and "lg" and the default value is "md".
        "disabled" can take 2 value namely true and false and the default value is false.
        "variant" can take 7 values "primary", "secondary", "tertiary", "positive primary", "positive secondary" , "negative primary" and "negative secondary" and the default value is "secondary".
        "label" takes a string as value and the default one is "click". 
"input" : "size","type" and "label"
    possible values for the features of "input" are:
        "size" can 2 two value small and medium used as "sm" and "md" and the default is "sm". 
        "type" can take 4 values namely "email","text","number" and "ip" and the default is "text". 
        "label" can take any string. Feel free to set the label if you get the context and the default is "Lable". 
"rich_text": "value"
"rich_text": "value"
    "value" takes any string and the default value is "<p>The world works with ServiceNow</p>".Feel free to edit the html string depending
    on what the user asks to accomodate itallic, bold, colors and font of text when asked by the user/command.
"heading": "variant" and "label"
    possible values for the features of "heading" are:
        "variant" can take 6 values namely "header-primary","header-secondary","header-tertiary","title-primary","title-secondary","title-tertiary", the default value is "header-primary".
        "label" can take any string, with default as "Lable", feel free to fill the value of "label" based on the context given.
    If the user ask for you to explain some subtopics then make another header component but its default value will be "title-primary".
    If the sub topics have sub topics further then make the header for those topics and set the value to "title-secondary" and so on.
"check_box": "size","checked","label","required"
    possible values for the features of "check box" are:
        "size": small and medium used as "sm" and "md" and the default is "sm".
        "checked": can take 2 values true and false. Default is false.
        "label": can take any string. If you get the context feel free to edit. default is "make your choice".
        "reuired": can take 2 value true or false. Default is true.

"pill":"label","size"
    possible values for the features of "pill" are:
    "label": fill it according to the context given. If you cannot get the context fill "text here".
    "size": "xs","sm" and "md" meaning extra small, small and medium respectively. "md" is default.




For example;
Command: "A webpage with a heading a rich text a text area a input and 2 buttons in a container one is small and another large"
Answer: 
[{         
    "heading_1":[],
    "rich_text_1":[],
    "textarea_1":[],
    "input_1":[],
    "container_1":["button_1","button_2"],
    "button_1":[],
    "button_2":[]
    } ,         
    {
    "heading_1":{"variant":"header-primary","label":"We make work, work better for people with modern digital workflows"}
    "rich_text_1":{"value":"<p>The world works with ServiceNow</p>"}
    "textarea_1":{"size":"sm","color":"initial","label":"Text Area"}
    "input_1":{"size":"sm","type":"text","label":"Label"}
    "container_1":{"type":"section","direction":"row"}
    "button_1":{"size":"sm", "disabled","False","variant":"secondary","label":"click"},
    "button_2":{"size":"lg","disabled":"False" ,"variant":"secondary","label":"click"},
    },
]
Since rich text feature "value" is a html string, we can edit it accordingly to accomodate color and font of the text when asked for in the input. 

Now let's add another section which contains styles of each component. 
The styles that exists are : "flex","background","box-shadow","margin" and "padding".

"flex" can take 3 values namely: "none", "grow", "shrink".
"background" can take any color code, if the user doesnt give us a code but mentions a color, feel free to get its closest color code.
"shadow" can take 5 values: "sm", "md", "lg", "xl", "xxl" which correspond to small, medium, large, extra large and extra extra large respectively.  
"margin" and "padding" take 8 values : "xxs", "xs", "sm", "md", "lg", "xl", "xxl", "3xl".
Command: "a web page with a button in a container and the container flex is grow, margin is medium, ppadding is medium, background having colour code 2626AC and box shadow as large."
ANSWER:
[
{
    "container_1":["button_1"],
    "button_1":[]
},
{
    "container_1":{"type":"section","direction":"row"},
    "button_1":{"size":"sm", "disabled",false,"variant":"secondary","label":"click"}
},
{
    "container_1":{"flex":"grow","margin":"md","padding":"md","background":"#2626AC","box-shadow":"lg"},
    "button_1":{}
}
]

Note that all the components have been mentioned in all the sections, and button was an empty dictionary in the third section as no information was given on the button's style.

If left for you use the mentioned styles and components and various combinations of those.
Expand the content for the features mentioned by the user in their individual containers. Use nested containers to keep related things together, and maybe flex-direction to row, so that it feels they are actually related.
Use your creativity at your fullest. Use styles like padding, margins, font sizes, font-family etc to make it look good. 
Set the sizes like width and height of containers appropriately so the components don't stretch out to the corners of the page.
Use the available components when there is a suitable component. use rich text to create any custom component that you want to create. Use <div>s extensively so that you can add styles for everything in detail. Dont forget to add styles in rich texts. try to use gray scaled colors.

If we ask for web page for a "project dashboard". use this as starting point and build up on it.

For rich-text, use the html tags like : div, a, abbr, acronym, address, b, bdi, bdo, blockquote, br, cite, code, del, dfn, em, i, ins, kbd, mark, q, s, samp, small, span, strong, sub, sup, time, u, var
For rich-text, use the css styles like: color, background-color, font-family, font-size, font-weight, text-align, text-decoration, text-transform, white-space, line-height, opacity, text-shadow, letter-spacing, word-spacing, overflow-wrap, word-break, hyphens, vertical-align, direction

Just write the list which has 3 sections.
First the flow and second the features of each element and 3rd the having styles of components if mentioned. Just write the list which has 3 sections nothing more.
Give the output in the format only. No extra text needed:
[{}, {}, {}]

Just print the answer with list of 3 sections nothing more.
